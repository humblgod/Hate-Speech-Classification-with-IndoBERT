# Hybrid-Model-indoBERT-Hate-Speech-Classification

This project is a research-based implementation of a **BERT** for hate speech classification. It was develop as a support model for my thesis. 

## üß† Project Overview

The aim of this project is to evaluate the performance of deep learning models‚Äîspecifically **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** on hate speech classification tasks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Notebook Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Core Libraries**:
  - `transformers`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/humblgod/Hate-Speech-Classification-with-IndoBERT.git
   cd Hate-Speech-Classification-with-IndoBERT
